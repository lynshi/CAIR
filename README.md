CAIR stands for Child in Automobile Identification and Rescue. CAIR detects children left alone in a car and contacts authorities if the temperature inside the car is becoming dangerous. This is a senior project developed by students at the Middlesex County Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Technologies.
